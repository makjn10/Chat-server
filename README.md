# **Chat-server (using socket programming)**
It is a basic chat server programmed to handle multiple users (clients) using socket programming. You can download / upload files from / to the server and send messaages through the server to other connected clients.  
In a multi-client chat server, N clients are connected to a server and send messages. In this program, one of the clients send messages to the server and it(server) will sent back the messages to all other connected clients(we can say broadcast). The code is implemented using C language, with a TCP connection.
